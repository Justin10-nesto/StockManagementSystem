Entrepreneurs accelerate structural change by replacing  established, sclerotic firms.  \\n \\n 2 | P a g e  \\n Entrepreneurial  Skills  \\nEntrepreneurial skills are a crucial element of any entrepreneur\\'s success.  Entrepreneurial skills refer to \\nthe abilities and quali ties that  enable someone to start a business and make it grow  successfully over time.  \\n• Entrepreneurial skills can encompass a large range of both  soft and hard skills.  \\nEntrepreneurial Skills include:  \\ni. Business management skills  \\nii. Teamwork and leadership skills  \\niii. Communication and listening  \\niv. Customer service skills  \\nv. Financial skills  \\nvi. Analytical and problem -solving skills  \\nvii. Critical thinking skills  \\nviii. Strategic thinking and planning skills  \\nix. Technical skills  \\nx.

Learn how to manage finances.  \\n \\nTypes of Entrepreneurs  \\nSN Type of Entrepreneur  Approach to venture  \\n1. Innovators  Find new approaches, methods, or products that add value through \\nsolving a problem in a unique manner . \\nInnovators are those who come up with completely new ideas and \\nturn them into viable businesses.  \\nIn most cases, these entrepreneurs change the way people think \\nabout and do things. Example, Steve Jobs (Apple), Larry Page \\n(Google), Elon Musk (Paypal) , Salman Khan (Khan Academy)  \\n2. Creators  Make something new or see a problem that other people have not \\nnoticed  3 | P a g e  \\n 3. Market makers  Innovate or reinvent their market from a future perspective by \\nasking what the market could evolve into . \\nInnovate your market, then innovate your business. Fast -changing \\nmarkets demand fast -changing businesses.  Eg: Nespresso  \\n4. Expanders and scalers  Seek out opportunities to expand upon previously created \\nmethods, processes, or products . \\n5. Imitators  Copy certain business ideas and improve upon them. They are \\nalways looking for ways to make a particular product better so as to \\ngain an upper hand in the market.  \\nImitators are part of innovators who don’t stick to the terms set by \\nother people a nd have a lot of self -confidence. Eg Mark Zuckerberg . \\n \\nThe entrepreneurial mindset  \\nThe entrepreneurial mindset allows an entrepreneur to view the  world as full of possibilities.  \\nEntrepreneurial passion and spirit help entrepreneur overcome  obstacles to achieve their goals.  \\nWithin your industry of interest or area of study, what are the  challenges that create frustration? How can \\nthese be turned  into opportunities?  \\nEntrepreneurial mindset : an awareness and focus on identifying  an opportunity through solving a \\nproblem and a willingness to move forward to advance that idea.  \\nThe entrepreneurial mindset is the lens through which the entrepreneur views the world, where \\neverything is considered i n light of the entrepreneurial business.  \\n• The mindset becomes a way of life for the entrepreneur.  \\n \\nDiscuss  \\n1. What is the difference between entrepreneurial mindset and entrepreneurial spirit?  \\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.  \\nAn entrepreneurial mindset refers to a way of thinking that is focused on identifying and pursuing \\nopportunities, being adaptable and resilient, taking calculated risks, and being persistent in the face of \\nchallenges. This mindset is ch aracterized by creativity, innovation, and a willingness to learn and adapt. It \\ncan be developed and cultivated through education, training, and experience.  \\nEntrepreneurial spirit, on the other hand, refers to a more intangible quality that is often associated with \\nsuccessful entrepreneurs. It encompasses qualities such as passion, drive, determination, and a strong \\nsense of purpose. It is often said that entrepreneurial spirit is something that you are born with, and it is \\ndifficult to teach or learn . \\nIn summary, entrepreneurial mindset refers to a way of thinking and problem -solving, while \\nentrepreneurial spirit involves personal qualities and attributes associated with successful \\nentrepreneurship.  4 | P a g e  \\n Entrepreneurial Attributes that enable drive  \\nEntrepr eneurial drive is something of an umbrella term for the wide variety of characteristics that compel \\nan individual to pursue a unique and untested path relentlessly, regardless of the failures and obstacles. \\nThe characteristics below all overlap with drive in some way, to ultimately create a template for the \\nentrepreneurial mentality:  \\ni. Vision  - The entrepreneur must be able to create and communicate an easily understandable \\nvision of what the new venture does in order to successfully launch a new business  \\nii. Creativity  - The entrepreneur must be able to inject imagination and uniqueness into a new \\nbusiness venture. It takes skill and ingenuity to create a new venture equipped with strategies \\nto outsmart the competition.  \\niii. Focus  - The entrepreneur must be able to ma intain the vision of the company with \\nunwavering diligence. It’s very easy to get sidetracked, especially if necessary to adapt the \\noriginal vision. Ironically, there are many successful entrepreneurs who get bored easily.  \\niv. Passion  - Entrepreneurs must have  a desire to succeed in a business venture under their own \\ninitiative.  \\nv. Perseverance  - The entrepreneur must be able to keep going even when faced with seemingly \\nchallenging  obstacles . \\nvi. Opportunistic  nature  - The entrepreneur must take advantage of an upcoming trend or unite \\nunrelated processes to create a unique business venture. It helps, of course, to see the \\npossibilities before they even exist.  \\nvii. Problem -solving ability  - The entrepreneur must thrive on coming up with solutions to \\ncomplex challenges.  \\nviii. Self-discipline  - The entrepreneur must be organized and regimented in pursuit of a successful \\nbusiness venture. This includes frugality, which is knowing how to stretch every cent so that \\nexpenditures are as low as possible.  \\n \\nThe Entrepreneurial Journey  \\nThe entrepreneurial journey is your exploration to discover if entrepreneurship is right for you. Every \\nentrepreneurial journey is unique; no two individuals will experience it in the same way. Along the way, \\nyou will find opportunities and risks coupled w ith challenges and rewards.  The steps are:  \\nStep 1 : Inspiration  – What is your motivation for becoming an entrepreneur?  \\nStep 2 : Preparation – Do you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur?  \\nStep 3 : Assessment – What is the idea you plan to offer through your venture?  \\nStep 4 : Exploring Resources – What resources and characteristics do you need to make this venture \\nwork?  \\nThe idea of ex ploring resources includes many other options besides how to fund a new venture . In a trial \\nrun, you would offer you r product or service for sale within a limited market on a test basis to evaluate \\nwhat additional resources are needed to support the success.  5 | P a g e  \\n Step 5 : Business Plan – What type of business structure and business model will your venture have?  \\nThe challenges at this step is to remain focuse d on managing your resources to meet your goals and \\noutcomes as you write your business plan for your new venture. Be hones t with yourself by running a \\nreality check about your ability to manage a venture, esp ecially from a personal -capacity perspective.  \\nStep 6 : Navigation  – In what direction will you take your venture? Where will you go for guidance?  \\nBy nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset, you will be better prepared when opportunities, challenges or \\nobstacle s surface. On your entrepreneurial journey, evaluating the experience or situation is a perfect \\nopportunity for you to determine how realistic, overambitious, or shortsighted your dreams and goals for \\nyour ventures may be.  \\nStep 7 : Launch – When and how wil l you launch your venture?  \\nBy this point , you have made improvements to your product through feedback received in your trial run. \\nYou’ve identified the value or benefits provided by your product. You’ve identified your target market and \\nlocation of your launch, whether it is a geographical location or an internet location.  \\n \\nThe Entrepreneurial Lifestyle and Career  \\nChoosing the path of entrepreneurship requires a willingness to  take on calculated ri sks The difference \\nbetween risk and calculated risk i s due diligence  or conducting the necessary research and  investigation \\nto make informed decisions that minimize risk.  \\n• Every entrepreneurial journey is unique; No two individuals will  experience it in the same way.  \\nAlong the way, you will find opportunities  and risks combined  with challenges and rewards.  \\nDeveloping a venture can be an exciting and active experience  It is also a lot of hard work, which \\ncan be equally rewarding . \\n \\nEntrepreneurship theories  \\nEntrepreneurship is accepting challenges and finding in novative solutions  to them.  The main theories of \\nentrepreneurship:  \\ni. Innovation Entrepreneurship theory  \\nii. Economic Entrepreneurship theory  \\niii. Opportunity based Entrepreneurship theory  \\niv. Resource -based Entrepreneurship theory  \\nv. Process of stage Entrepreneurship theory  \\n \\nExplanation on each theory  \\ni. Innovation Entrepreneurship theory  \\nWhat makes entrepreneurs different from normal businessmen is finding innovative solutions and having \\nforesight . Joseph Alois Schumpeter, one of the greatest economists, put forth the well -known innovative \\ntheory which changed the entrepreneur’s perspective. According to Schumpeter, entrepreneurs take the \\nstationary economy to a new level of development by adding innovation and creativity of their own. \\nSchumpet er also stated that entrepreneurs bring innovation in two ways namely:  \\n1. By reducing the cost of production  \\n2. By increasing the demand for certain products  \\n 6 | P a g e  \\n ii. Economic Entrepreneurship theory  \\nThis theory was proposed by Richard Cantillon who considered the econo my as one of the fields affected \\nby entrepreneurship. According to Cantillon, an entrepreneur acts as both ‘producers’ and ‘exchangers’ . \\nAn entrepreneur’s action greatly affects the supply chain of raw products being collected, to become an \\nend product for  consumers. Cantillon included everyone as an entrepreneur from their little actions \\nstarting from a beggar to restaurant owners as they also have their source of unfixed income; this counts \\nas a unique factor and made his theory stand out from other entre preneurship theories.  \\n \\niii. Opportunity based Entrepreneurship theory  \\nPeter Drucker in his theory stated that “this defines entrepreneur and entrepreneurship, the entrepreneur \\nalways searches for change, responds to it and exploits it as an opportunity ”. Peter Drucker and Howard \\nStevenson focused on a wide -ranging conceptual framework of entrepreneurship and hence contradicted \\nSchumpeter’s theory which stated entrepreneurship as change.  \\n \\niv. Resource -based Entrepreneurship theory  \\nThis theory states that entrepreneurs need resources to start and carry their businesses . Money and time \\nalone are not sufficient for a blooming startup; hence Entrepreneurs require resources to make their \\nefforts productive. Also, the theory’s main focus is on showing the importance of financial, social, and \\nhuman resources and in the process enhance an individual’s abilities.  \\n \\nv. Process of stage Entrepreneurship theory  \\nThis theory is once again divided into five stages describing the development journey of an entrepreneur . \\nIt is a widely accepted theory by Venkat Rao. The five steps of entrepreneurship development according \\nto this theory are: - \\n1. Simulation for stimulation of entrepreneurship  \\n2. Identifying abilities and capacities of entrepreneurship  \\n3. Expansion and development stage  \\n4. Publicity foundation/Promotion  \\n5. Feedback  \\n \\nEntrepreneurial Marketing  \\nMarketing is an umbrella term given to those activities that entrepreneurs use to identify consumers and \\nconvert them into  buyers for the purposes of achievi ng a profit.  \\nNo matter the size of the ve nture, marketing lays the foundation  for how entrepreneurs reach and serv e \\ntarget customers . \\nWhether it\\'s a global brand such as Apple, a small - to mid -size company such as a small restaurant or local \\ngym,  \\n• Marketing  refers to the core strategies companies use to reach and se ll to customers . \\nAs you might expect, the way entrepreneurs market their  new product is somewhat different from how a \\nlarge  company m arkets an establishe d brand .  \\n• Being a successful entrepreneur often means being able to balance the many different respects \\nof a business, such as financing , accounting  and management . 7 | P a g e  \\n Marketing  \\n• Identifying companies that have the interest, expertise and  resources to develop products in \\nsimilar fields as your  invention can be extremely helpful in gathering information,  feedback and \\ninterest in your invention.  \\n• Potential investors can also be a valuable source of  information. We welcome your inputs on \\npotent ial contacts  in industry and business, and we will also identify contacts  for engagement.  \\n• Marketing channels, including website, technology  exchanges, and trade shows may be used to \\ncommunicate  your invention.  \\n \\n \\n \\nEXTRAS  on Entrepreneurship theories  \\nvi. The th eory of need for achievement  \\nthe theory of need for achievement emphasizes the importance of personal traits and motivations for \\nsuccessful entrepreneurship. According to this theory, individuals with a high need for achievement are \\nmore likely to be succe ssful entrepreneurs. Such individuals have a strong desire to take personal \\nresponsibility for achieving challenging goals, a willingness to take risks, and a strong drive to succeed. \\nThe theory focuses on individual characteristics and traits associated w ith successful entrepreneurship.  \\n \\nvii. Sociological Entrepreneurship theory  \\nThis theory talks about the social aspects of entrepreneurship. If an entrepreneur considers all the social \\naspects such as social taboos, customs, culture, and other religious beliefs, they might have a well -\\nestablished business that is up to mark with every consumer’s expectation. Max Weber propounded the \\nsociological entrepreneurship theory and stated that entrepreneurs should accept the system of a society \\nfor the development  of themselves as well as their startup.  \\n \\n \\n8 | P a g e  \\n viii. Psychological Entrepreneurship theory  \\nPsychological theories are of three sections. They are based on the personal characteristics of a typical \\nentrepreneur.  \\n1. Locus of control  - Any entrepreneur’s success can be an outcome of internal locus of control as \\nwell as the outer locus of control i.e., his or her Inside abilities and support from outside.  \\n2. Theory of personality traits  - The inborn qualities of an individual are the one that naturally makes \\nthem an entrepre neur.  \\n3. Theory of need for achievement  - Entrepreneurs are driven by a need for achievement and it \\neventually makes them succeed.  \\nNow, these three characteristics distinguish various types of entrepreneurs based on psychological \\nentrepreneurship theories.  \\n \\nix. Anthropological Entrepreneurship theory  \\nIt relates to the cultural model of entrepreneurs. Anthropologists study the human aspects within the past \\nand present. This makes them good observers of society and hence according to them, to have a successful \\nventu re, entrepreneurs should consider the social and cultural contexts.  \\nEntrepreneurs can find possibilities that present themselves as difficulties because of the social aspects \\nof business activities (social or environmental). It pushes them to come up with  new ways to solve \\ndifficulties, or at the very least contribute to their solutions.  \\n \\nLECTURE 3  – 5/5/23  \\nENTREPRENEURIAL MARKETING  \\nMarketing is an umbrella term given to those activities that  entrepreneurs use to identify consumers and  \\nconvert them into buyers for the purposes of achieving a profit.   \\nNo matter the size of the venture, marketing lays the foundation  for how a n entrepreneur reaches and \\nserves its target customers . Whether it\\'s a global brand such as Apple, a small - to mid -size company s uch \\nas a small restaurant or local gym, ma rketing refers to the core strategies companies use to reach and sell \\nto customers.  \\nAs you might expect, the way entrepreneurs market their  new product is somewhat different from how a \\nlarge  company markets an established brand.  \\n \\nTraditional marketing  \\nTraditional marketing for large businesses such as Coca -Cola Disney, Ube r, Amazon and Dell tend to focus \\non managing and growing existing programs and brands.  Companies like these enjoy greater resources \\nsuch as  substantial financial support and large numbers of  marketing professionals to steer their effor ts. \\nExamples of traditional marketing practices  are print advertising, television advertising, radio advertising, \\ndirect mail, cold calling, trade shows.  \\n \\n 9 | P a g e  \\n Entrepr eneurial marketing  \\nEntrepreneurial marketing is a set of unconventional  practices that can help entrepreneurs to emerge and  \\nhave  an edge  in competitive markets . \\nEntrepreneurial marketing emphasizes flexibility and innovation as a way to stake a claim within \\ncompetitive markets.  \\nThe main difference between th is and traditional  approaches is that entrepreneurial marketing tends  to \\nfocus  on satisfying the customer and building trust by providing  innovative products and services that \\nappeal to a specific  market.  \\nExamples of entrepreneurial  marketing practices  are Guerilla marketing, content marketing, influencer \\nmarketing, viral marketing, referral marketing.  \\n \\nMarketing Mix  \\nTarget market is the specific group of consumer s for which  a company seeks to provide a good or service.  \\nMarketing mix  are tools entrepreneurs use to gain reaction  from the target market.  \\nOne common way of understanding and remembering the  components of the marketing mix for products \\nand services  is by thinking in terms of the \" 7 Ps .\" First four relate more to  products: Product, Pricing,  \\nPromotion, and Place . The remaining three relate more to services: Physical  environment, Process, and \\nPeople . \\n \\n10 | P a g e  \\n 1. Product  \\nProduct  refers to a good or service that creates value by  fulfilling a customer  need or desire.  Goods are \\ntangible products that can be touched.  smelled, heard, and seen. In contrast, services are  intangible \\nproducts.  \\nDefining the value of the products you are going to offer  is an important step toward identifying a \\ncompetitive  advantage within a marketplace.  \\n \\n2. Promotion  \\nCommunicating a product\\'s benefits to customers is a  significant aspect of any marketing mix.  Even if a \\nproduct is the best in its class, a company must  communicate th e value to customers, or it will f ail. This is  \\nwhat promotion does.  Promotions must have a goal, a budget, a strategy, and an outcome to measure.  \\n• Promotion  is the process of communicating value to customers in  a way that encourages them to \\npurchase the good or  service.  \\nSome typical forms o f promotion are advertising social  media, public relations. direct mail, sales \\npromotions and  personal selling.  \\nAdvertising  is a form of mass communication that allows companies to reach a broad audience through \\nTV, radio, newspaper, Internet, magazines, and outdoor ads. Many of these media can be quite expensive \\nfor small companies, forcing them to choose one strategy, or to opt for other less expensive tactics such \\nas guerrilla marketing  or viral marketing  (which will addressed in  Marketing Techniques and Tools for \\nEntrepreneurs ).. \\nSocial media  is a must -use tool for entrepreneurs to connect with consumers, especially younger \\ndemographics. Many customers can be found online in one social media platform or another. The goal is \\nto find the customers who fit your target  market. The benefits of social media include targeting customers \\nmore accurately using the platform of their choice and being able to communicate directly with them. \\nThese platforms include networking sites such as  Facebook,  Twitter, and  LinkedIn; photo a nd video sites \\nsuch as  Snapchat,  Instagram, and  Pinterest; blogs; and news sites. A business must find the time to \\nconnect with its customers wherever they are.  \\nYou may benefit from buying ads that can be geographically targeted to your customer and that a re more \\naffordable and effective because you’re directly targeting someone who is specifically interested in your \\nproduct. The disadvantages of targeting social media include the time and skills required . \\nPublic relations  are the efforts and tools companie s use to connect and develop goodwill with their \\nconstituents . Constituents  can include customers, investors, employees, business partners, government \\nentities, and the community at large. The goal is to highlight the company in a positive light by contrib uting \\nas a community player. Tools can include newsletters, press conferences, community service, events, \\nsponsorships, press releases, articles, and stories that help entrepreneurs create a positive image about \\ntheir company and get its name out there.  \\nDirect mail , which is a way to connect to consumers via email or through printed, mailed pieces, is also a \\nnecessary tool to keep in touch with customers, especially when creating long -term relationships. The \\nadvantage of this strategy lies in connecting to a customer who is already interested in your product and \\nwould like to receive news and promotions from you; however, the disadvantage is that it usually takes \\ntime to create these list s of customers  and their details . 11 | P a g e  \\n Sales promotions  are incentives that attract attention and push the customer to take action. \\nThese  incentives  include discounts, samples, rebates, rewards programs, gifts, and premiums. Sales \\npromotions can attract new customers, but it may also reduce profits because coupons and discounts ar e \\noffered for trying a product.  \\nPersonal selling  is a tool that uses face -to-face interactions to communicate and influence a customer to \\nmake a purchase. It is especially suited for luxury goods. Usually, higher -priced products will need a longer \\nselling process, and sales personnel will need more training on the product to learn about its unique \\nqualities. This is one of the most expensive ways to reach and retain customers, but it can be worth the \\ninvestment.  \\nOverall, a good entrepreneur must find the ri ght mix of marketing communications to reach customers. \\nThis will vary depending on the start -up’s budget, goals, and strategies.

Price \\nOne of the most imp ortant and challenging elements of  the marketing mix is pricing.  \\n• Price  is the value that must be exchanged for a customer  to receive a product or service.  \\nThis is usually monetary and has a direct impact on sales . Correctly pricing your product enables your \\nstart -up to be  competitive w hile ma ximizing your product\\'s profit  potential . \\n \\nWhile pricing must be established when starting a new business, pricing strategies should be reviewed on \\nan ongoing basis. These occasions in particular merit consideration:  \\n• When adding a new product or service to your offerings  \\n• When demand shift s (due to market, consumer, or other factors)  \\n• When entering a new market  \\n• When competitors are making changes  \\n• When your costs are changing  \\n• When adjusting products/services or strategies  \\n \\nHere are several methods that entrepreneurs can use to  effectively price products : \\ni. Cost -led pricing  is the easiest way to price a product. This involves taking the cost of making the \\nproduct and creating a profit margin, which is how much profit your business stands to make after \\ncosts have been deducted.  \\n \\nii. Customer led pricing  \\nThe pricing led by the customer . You ask what the consumer is willing to pay and charge that. You can find \\nthis by doing research and asking customers what they would be willing to pay for a product. Many \\ntechnology products are priced th at way. Companies survey customers about what they are willing to pay, \\nand they create products that deliver the value at the market price.  \\n 14 | P a g e  \\n iii. Premium Pricing (Perceived value pricing)  \\nAnother way to price a product or service is to consider what the competition is charging and determine \\nwhether to go above, below, or match their prices. If going above, or using premium pricing (also called \\nperceived value pricing), you need a clear reas on why customers would want to spend more on your \\nproduct.  \\n \\niv. Penetration Pricing  \\nWhile using penetration pricing, or pricing below competitors , can give you a competitive advantage, it \\nmay also lead to “price wars” in which competitors keep dropping prices in an attempt to beat each other. \\nObviously, the disadvantage is diminished profits for all. While pricing the same as your competitors \\nseems like a logical choice, if your product offers no added value, this strategy is unlikely to entice \\ncustomers  to switch to your brand.  \\n \\nv. Loss leader pricing   \\nUses a below -standard price to attract  business in the hope that customers will stay and sh op for other  \\nmore profitable products.  It is called a loss leader because companies lose money on the lower -priced \\nproduct. Grocery store ads usually contain several loss leaders that are designed to lure you into their \\nstore in the hopes that you do the rest of your food shopping there.  \\n \\nvi. Introductory offers pricing   \\nUse lower initial prices to attract new  customers  and build -customer base before prices retur n to \"normal.  \\n \\nvii. Skimming pricing   \\nIs a pricing strategy that leverages the  newness of a product to justify the highest price possible in order  \\nto \"skim\" the most profits off the top.  \\n \\nviii. Bundling Pricing  \\nA discount price is set for a bundle of products  to encourage customers to buy in bulk.  \\n \\nix. Odd numbers pricing   \\nIs a psychological pricing strate gy often used in conjunction with other pricing methods to m ake a \\nproduct\\'s price point more attractive to consum er. For example, instead of pricing something at $20, the \\nprice would be set at $19.99, which consumers perceive as closer to 19 than 20.  \\n \\n4. Place  \\nPlace refers to the channels or locations -physical or digital  where  customers can purchase products:  It is \\nsometimes called distribution. For the entrepreneur, the choice  of place lies in figuring out which channel: \\nwill create the most  profit.  \\nIn other words, which channels will reach the majority of the target  market at the most efficient cost.  \\nChoosing the r ight distribution channels is one way to create competitive advantage and generate more  \\nsuccess for your  business.  \\nCertain channels have specific capabilities such as teaching more  customers, providing promotions, and \\nprovi ding credit . 15 | P a g e  \\n  \\n \\n5. People  \\nPeople, or a company\\'s human resources, will always be a  key factor in any successful business.  Because \\nthe service is the product, they are the face of  the brand and a direct link between the company and the  \\ncustomer.  \\n• When an employee delivers an acceptab le or outstanding  service, customers are encouraged to \\nreturn to purchase  the service again and also share their positive experience  with others.  \\n \\n6. Physical Environment  \\nThe physical environment where a service is provided is an  important part of the market ing mix.   \\nIt can influence the company\\'s image and convey a lot of  information about the quality of a product, \\nservice.  company, or brand.  \\n• Tangible cues -decor, smell, music, temperature, colors  send an immediate message to customers \\nabout  quality  and profe ssionalism.  \\nSince a service cannot be inspected before it is received  cues help customers make their decisions.  \\n \\n7. Process  \\nProcess is the chain of procedures or activities required to  provide a service to the customer.  \\nIt is all of the activities that take place between the service  provider and the customer , from beginning to \\nend. In the case of services that are provided online, process  includes the website\\'s design and \\nfunctionality, and all of  the steps customers take from browsing through check out.  \\n16 | P a g e  \\n EXTRAS  \\nDifference s between Traditional marketing and Entrepreneurial Marketing  \\nTraditional Marketing  Entrepreneurial Marketing  \\nGreater amount of resources  Few to no resources; founder drives efforts \\n(sweat equity)  \\nManagement of an established brand, \\nreminder advertising  Must be ingenious, energetic, and persistent to \\ndevelop story and brand; leads to trust  \\nFinancial and market share goals  Satisfaction and awareness goals  \\nManage existing customers  Capture first customers; develop a client base  \\nand long -term relationships  \\nManage existing products, promotion, \\npricing, placement, people, physical \\nenvironment, and process (the “7 Ps”)  Develop new products, price points, channels \\n(placement), communication, process, training, \\nand design  \\nContinue doing what works  Trial and error; market pilots  \\nCommunication with customers \\nstandardized, one -directional; more difficult \\nto create one -on-one relationships  Communication with customers is more fluid \\nand spontaneous; two -way relationships  \\n \\nMarketing Techniques  and Tools for Entrepreneurs  \\nOne of the har dest facts for entrepreneurs to absorb whe n starting a new business is that financi al and \\nhuman resources are li mited. Fortunatel y, there are many marketing techniques  available to \\nentrepreneurs that re quire little more th an a  good dose of \"swe at equity ”. \\n• Marketing techniques entrepreneurs can use are guerilla , relationship, expeditionary, real -time, \\nviral , digital , word -of-mouth. \\n \\n1. Guerilla Mar keting  \\nGuerrilla marketing  refers to creative approaches to marketing that seek to gain maximum exposure \\nthrough uncon ventional means . Guerilla marketing often means staging some sort of event or interaction \\nthat is designed to attract attention to a brand or product. The goal is to intrigue consumers by standing \\nout from normal sales messages and the thousands of adverti sements they are exposed to every day. \\nThese approaches usually have a component that encourages potential customers to interact with a \\ncompany or product in a fun way.  \\nAn example of guerrilla mark eting that has been prominent over the last few years is flash mobs. A flash \\nmob is a gathering of people at a public place to perform an act, be it a dance, entertainment, political \\nstance, or some sort of artistic expression that conveys a message to the  public for a brief period of time.  17 | P a g e  \\n 2. Relationship Marketin g \\nRelationship marketing  seeks to create customer loyalty through personal interactions and long -term \\nengagement strategies . A small company can try to have a closer relationship with clients by writing \\npersonal notes by hand or sending an email thanking them for their business, by acknowledging their \\npresence by their f irst or last name when they come into the establishment, by offering beverages, and \\nby offering other personalized services.  \\n• One of the main differences between start -up companies and established brands is the need for \\nstart -ups to nurture and maintain relationships with new customers. One way to accomplish this \\nis through relationship marketing  \\n \\n3. Expeditionary Marke ting \\nExpeditionary marketing  refers to strategies that are aimed at moving established companies and their \\nproducts into new markets and territories. As the name implies, there is an element of risk and discovery \\ninvolved in expeditionary marketi ng strategies as they help a company grow into new areas. Determining \\nwhere and how to effectively enter these new markets often begins with an analysis of a company’s \\ncurrent market and its financial and human resources. Entrepreneurs will choose new mark ets based on \\nwhere those resources might be able to fulfill an unmet need. Many small businesses need to leverage \\ntheir gains as they move into new waters and perhaps more competitive landscapes. Having awareness \\nof changes can foster planning and look for  new ways to expand.  \\n \\n4. Real -time Marketing  \\nReal -time marketing  attempts to turn immediately available sales data (often collected from social media, \\nwebsites, point -of-sale systems, and the like) into actionable and timely strategies that target the shifting \\nlandscape of consumer tastes and trends. Some of the tools entrepreneurs can use to secure information \\ninclude analytics from Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well a s internal sales data.  \\n \\n5. Viral Marketing  \\nViral marketing is a technique that uses engaging content  in the hopes that viewers will share it on their  \\npersonal and  social media networks.  Successful content then spreads like a virus , creating  exponential \\nexposure to a company\\'s message.  \\n• The most important element of any viral marketing  campaign is developi ng content that is not \\nonly  engaging but that people also feel must be shared.  \\nViral marketers often create a lot of content that does  not go viral before finding content that does.  \\n \\n6. Digital Marketing  \\nDigital marketing refers collectively to all digital (online)  marketing effects, which can include social media, \\nemail  commun ications, websites, blogs and vlogs, and search engine  optimization SEO).  This is an \\nimportant area for entrepreneurs to explore because  learning how to leverage digital channels and online \\nanalytics  is key to remaining competitive in this technological er a. 18 | P a g e  \\n Digital ad spending has outpaced television ad spending in  recent years. Digital ads include display ads. \\nsearch ads, and  social  media ads.  \\n• These can be very successful at targeting specific people in  your target market and are usually \\nmore affordable t han a TV  ad. \\n \\n7. Word -of-mouth  Marketing  \\nWord-of-mouth (WOM) marketing occurs when a satisfied  customer tells others about their positive \\nexperience with a  good or service.  Although similar to viral marketing, WOM does not involve  active \\nparticipation from the marketer and almost  exclusively involves only customers, whereas viral  marketing \\nattempts to build awareness and buzz mostly  via videos or email.  \\n• When consumers are very happy with their purchases,  they will let people know, whether it is in \\nperson or on  social media.  \\n \\nSummary on Marketing Te chniques  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n19 | P a g e  \\n ENTREPRE NEURIAL BRANDING  \\nIn a business context, the word brand has multiple  meanings.  \\n• First, a brand name is the name of a product or service  offered by a company . \\n• Brand also means the image a company promotes and  the connotations it fosters of itself and its \\nproducts.  \\n• A logo, advertising messages, public perception, celebri ty endorsements, promotional strat egies, \\nand other factors all play a part in promoting a company\\'s particular brand . \\n \\nBrand  \\nA brand  is the set of expectations, memories, stories and  relationships that taken together, account for a \\nconsumer\\'s  decision to choose one product or service over another.  \\nA brand is a nam e, sign, symbol, design, or combination of  these elements intende d to identify the \\nproducts or services  of one marketer and to differentiate them from those of the  competition.  \\nTherefore: Branding  is the marketing practice of creating  name, symbol or des ign that identifies and \\ndifferentiates a  product from other product s. \\n• An effective brand strategy gives you a major edge in  increasingly competitive markets.  \\n \\nImportance of Branding  \\n1. Influencing purchasing decisions.  \\nBranding can be the deciding factor for consumers when they  make a purchase decision . In fact, a 2021 \\nRazorfish study fo und that 82% of su rveyed consumers buy from brands that stand for a  greater mission \\nor purpose.  \\n \\n2. Creates an identity for your business.  \\nA brand extends beyond business product or service. Branding  gives your business an identity. It gives \\nconsumers something to  relate  to and connect with beyond the product or service they ’re actually \\npurchasing  \\n \\n3. Helps customers remember your business.  \\nBranding makes your business memorable . It\\'s the face of  your business and helps consumers distinguish \\nyour  business across every medium.  \\n \\n4. Boosts advertising and marketing  \\nBranding supports your marketing and advertising efforts.  It helps your promotion pack that extra punch \\nwith adde d recognition and impact.  \\n \\n5. Builds employee support  \\nBranding brings your employees pride. Strong branding  brings in strong employees  \\n \\n \\n \\n 20 | P a g e  \\n Important  Elements of brand identity  \\n1. Wordmark or Log o \\nA logo or wordmark is one of the primary elements of on  organization brand identity. The logo  refers to \\na graphical symb ol and wordmark  is simply the n ame of the company that utilizes a distinct text -only \\ntypographic treatment.  \\nA few examples include well -known brands such as FedEx. Mobil , CNN, and Coca -Cola.  \\n \\n2. Corporate  Font  \\nYou need to decide which fonts you want to use on your write  and on your other marketing col lateral, in \\nmany case s, you r brand  design agency will select a typeface from the logo itself.  \\n \\n3. Shape and Form  \\nAnother important aspect of brand identity is the shape and form  of di fferen t elements that represent \\nyour brand. If your logo  comprises sof t edges and circles then people will react differently  to it compared \\nto when they see a logo that is square and sharp . \\n \\n4. Theme Lines/Tag Lines  \\nTag lines or theme lines help in easily identifying the brand. If the  theme line becomes popular, it becomes \\npart of brand identity  and people tend  to remember them for long.  \\n \\nElement  of Branding  \\n1. Aroma : The distin ct smell which the user experiences  before, during, or after he uses the offering.  \\n2. Sound : The sound used in the marketin g messages to  reinf orce the brand identity.  \\n3. Vision : The group of goals or objective behind the brand  that help guide its activities and its future  \\n4. Colour : A colour mostly used by the b usiness in its marketin g messages to describe or \\ncomplement the  brand  \\n \\nTypes of Branding  \\n1. Product branding  \\nProduct branding is one of the most common types of  branding where the offering i s given an identi ty \\nand a personality to make it identifiable and differentiable in the  market.  \\nAn example of product branding could be Mountain De w. Mountain Dew has its own name, colour, voice \\nand personality. One can recognize  the brand even when the  generic product is not even there  \\n \\n2. Personal Branding  \\nPersonal branding is very common among politicians,  Celebrities , athletes and othe r people who have \\nniche  followership.  It is easier for these people to  create an image for themselves among their followers.  \\nMichael Jordan is a perfect example of personal branding  who, because of his niche followership, was not \\nonly able  to benefit himself by launching his own apparel line bu t also benefited Nike which partnered \\nwith him to launch  the same.  21 | P a g e  \\n 3. Corporate  Branding  \\nCorporate Branding gives an identity to the offering  provider and opens new opportunities for him to \\nextend his  offerings portfolio easily.  \\nCorporate branding is also of vital importance when it  comes to hiring as employees always desire t o work \\nwith a  company with a known brand.  \\nPepsiCo is a good example of corporate branding. The company has several products lines in its product \\nmix including Frito -Lay, Pepsi. Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew , Gatorade, Tropicana, etc, all of which are owned \\nand operated by the parent brand  - PepsiC o. \\n \\n4. Geographical Branding  \\nGeographical or regional branding is often used by the  tourism industry who create a brand out of a  \\ngeographical location by assigning it certain  characterist ics and experience to attract more vis itors. \\nFor example , Hawaii is being marketed  as the perfect  destination to visit if you want to go to beautiful \\nislands lined with beaches of warm white and verd ant, and flora.  \\n \\nNext S ession  \\nINNOVATION  \\nHow much of innovation is inspiration, and how much is hard  work?  \\ninnovation is the  spec ific function  of entreprene urship, whether in an existing business a public service \\ninstitution  or a new ve nture started by a lone individual  in th e family  kitchen.  \\nIt is the means by which the entrepreneur either crea tes new wealth -producing resources of endows \\nexisting  resources with enhanced po tential for creating wealth  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '"
